 # DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE

 This package creates a custom differential drive, launches it in gazebo and runs a node flip to flip the differential drive. 

 To launch gazebo run `roslaunch diff_drive ddrive_rviz.launch`
 It will be launched in the paused state. Play gazebo to make sure simulation runs and the robot flips about.
